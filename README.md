### MiniNetSim - A network simulator



First, I learnt the basics of object oriented programming and built a Shapes class with a GUI build using C++ and SFML. I made a UML diagram as part of the exercise.

Then, I went through the code of a CPU job-scheduling discrete event simulator (DES) which would help me in implementing the network simulator. The codebase of the DES is included in this repo.



This project is being done as part of Seasons of Code, 2025, organised by WnCC, IIT Bombay.
